# 10 Weeks

Welcome to 10 Weeks, a journey through ten unique projects. The first week of summer slipped by in a haze—no deadlines, no momentum, and no real drive to create. That changes now.

This showcase is a commitment to action: each week, I’ll take on a new project with real stakes—creative, financial, physical, etc.—and document the process here and on social media. Follow along as I learn, build, and grow.
